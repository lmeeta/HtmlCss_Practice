    <h1>What Is Love?</h1>

    <hr />

    <h2 id="def1">Defination</h2>
    <p>
      Love encompasses a range of strong and positive emotional and mental
      states, <br />
      from the most sublime virtue or good habit, the deepest interpersonal
      affection, <br />
      to the simplest pleasure.<br />
      Love is considered to be both positive and negative,<br />
      with its virtue representing human kindness, compassion, and affection,<br />
      as "the unselfish loyal and benevolent concern for the good of another"
      and its vice representing human moral flaw, <br />
      akin to vanity, selfishness, amour-propre, and egotism, as potentially
      leading people into a type of mania, obsessiveness or codependency
    </p>

    <h2 class="love">Impersonal</h2>
    <p class="mvlove">
      Individuals can be characterized as having a profound dedication and
      immense appreciation for an object, principle, or objective, thereby
      experiencing a sense of love towards it.
      <br />
      For example, compassionate outreach and volunteer workers' "love" of their
      cause may sometimes be born not of interpersonal love but impersonal love,
      altruism, and strong spiritual or political convictions.
    </p>

    <h2 id="def1">Interpersonal</h2>
    <p>
      Interpersonal love refers to love between human beings. It is a much more
      potent sentiment than a simple liking for a person.<br />
      Unrequited love refers to those feelings of love that are not
      reciprocated. Interpersonal love is most closely associated with
      interpersonal relationships.<br />
      Such love might exist between family members, friends, and couples. There
      are also a number of psychological disorders related to love, such as
      erotomania.
    </p>

    <h2 class="love">Biological basis</h2>
    <p class="mvlove">
      Biological models of sex tend to view love as a mammalian drive, much like
      hunger or thirst.<br />
      Attraction is the more individualized and romantic desire for a specific
      candidate for mating,<br />
      which develops out of lust as commitment to an individual mate forms.
      Recent studies in neuroscience have indicated that as people fall in
      love,<br />
      the brain consistently releases a certain set of chemicals, including the
      neurotransmitter hormones, dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin, the
      same compounds released by amphetamine,<br />
      stimulating the brain's pleasure center and leading to side effects such
      as increased heart rate, loss of appetite and sleep, and an intense
      feeling of excitement. <br />
      Research has indicated that this stage generally lasts from one and a half
      to three years
    </p>
    <hr />

    <h2 id="def1">Adaptive benefit</h2>
    <p>
      Interpersonal love between a male and a female is considered to provide an
      evolutionary adaptive benefit since it facilitates mating and sexual
      reproduction.<br />
      However, some organisms can reproduce asexually without mating. Thus
      understanding the adaptive benefit of interpersonal love depends on
      understanding the adaptive benefit of sexual reproduction as opposed to
      asexual reproduction.
