      The Pekin or White Pekin is an American breed of domestic duck, raised
      primarily for meat.[6][7] It derives from birds brought to the United
      States from China in the nineteenth century,[8] and is now bred in many
      parts of the world.[6] It is often known as the American Pekin to
      distinguish it from the German Pekin, a distinct and separate breed which
      derives from the same Chinese stock but has different breeding. Many of
      these ducks were reared on Long Island, New York, in the late nineteenth
      and early twentieth centuries, from which the breed derived its name Long
      Island Duck.
