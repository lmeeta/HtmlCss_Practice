    <h1>Water</h1>

    <p>
      Keeping your body properly hydrated offers a lot of health benefits.
      However, drinking just any kind of water isn't ideal. The earth's surface
      is 71% water. While 97% is found in seas and oceans, only 3% is fresh
      water. Of this 3%, 79% is found in glaciers and ice caps, 29% in
      groundwater, and 1% as surface water. So of the total, less than 1% is
      drinkable and available for human consumption, found on the surface and in
      underground aquifers.
    </p>

    <h2>Different type of water</h2>

    <h3>Tap Water</h3>

    <p id="tap">
      The water that you get from your faucet is called tap water. This is
      generally sourced from a dam or river, treated at a water treatment
      facility, stored in a reservoir, and then supplied to homes through water
      pipelines. While the quality of tap water generally has to meet the
      government guidelines and often does at the water treatment plant,
      intermittent supply through old distribution pipelines (which run parallel
      to sewage lines in many cities of India), can render this water unsafe,
      especially during peak summer and during the rainy season which is prone
      to flooding.
    </p>

    <h3>Mineral Water</h3>

    <p id="mineral">
      Mineral Water, as the name suggests, is water enriched with vital
      minerals, mostly calcium and magnesium. Natural mineral water is taken
      from underground sources which are rich in mineral content and then
      packaged and sold as natural mineral water. Mineral water is water from a
      mineral spring that contains various minerals, such as salts and sulfur
      compounds. Mineral water may usually be still or sparkling
      (carbonated/effervescent) according to the presence or absence of added
      gases. Traditionally, mineral waters were used or consumed at their spring
      sources, often referred to as "taking the waters" or "taking the cure", at
      places such as spas, baths, or wells.
    </p>

    <h3>Packaged Drinking Water/Bottled water</h3>
    <p id="bottle">
      Simply put, packaged drinking water is water that has been treated with
      technologies such as Filtration, Reverse osmosis, UV, and Ozone in a water
      treatment plant and then filled into bottles/pouches and sealed. Often, in
      a bid to render the water “healthy,” calcium and magnesium salts are added
      in defined proportions to make it “mineral water”. The lacunae in this
      type of water are often in the treatment processes and in the handling and
      distribution itself. Unless the process is foolproof by combining all the
      technologies in their correct order, and the handling and distribution is
      done hygienically; bottled or packaged drinking water may be
      microbiologically unsafe.
    </p>

    <h3>Spring Water Or Glacier Water</h3>
    <p id="glacier">
      Spring Water or Glacier Water is sourced from, as you guessed it, springs
      and glaciers. Since water is collected right from the source, it is
      generally clean, and free from toxins and other unwanted particles. In
      some cases, depending on the spring or glacier it is collected from, the
      water might even be infused with vital minerals. If you get your spring or
      glacier water from authentic brands like Evian or Arrowhead, then you can
      rest assured that you are getting some of the best drinking water in the
      world. However, it is going to be very expensive compared to regular
      packaged water, let alone tap water.
    </p>

    <h3>Well Water</h3>
    <p id="well">
      Well, Water is not commonly seen in the cities and urban areas. However,
      it is a prime source of water supply in most rural regions. When it rains,
      the water trickles down the crevices into the soil and starts accumulating
      underground. A well is then drilled on top of one of these natural
      underground water reservoirs to directly collect from the water source
      beneath. This water is completely free to use, and if you have a
      well-constructed right in your backyard, it is probably the most
      convenient source of drinking water. But with that being said, it does
      carry some risks.
    </p>

    <h3>Distilled Water</h3>
    <p id="distilled">
      Distilled Water is any source of water that has been purified using the
      process of distillation. This involves boiling the water until it turns
      into water vapor, then capturing the gas and condensing it back into its
      liquid state. This is by far one of the safest types of water devoid of
      any contaminants and bacteria. However, is distilled water safe to drink?
      The lack of toxic contaminants, germs, and bacteria does make it seem like
      the safest kind of drinking water. But it is not! You see, besides lacking
      all the harmful impurities, distilled water also misses out on essential
      minerals and salt.
    </p>

    <h3>Hard Water</h3>
    <p id="hard">
      When the water has a high mineral content, it is called hard water. This
      happens when water percolates through several layers of limestone, chalk,
      and even gypsum which are high in calcium, magnesium carbonates,
      bicarbonates, and sulfates. Another reason for increased hardness in some
      areas is the depleting level of groundwater due to over-extraction. As a
      result, these compounds contaminate the water, increasing its hardness.
      Other elements in hard water may be compounds like iron, aluminum, and
      manganese which also add to hardness.
    </p>

    <h3>Alkaline water</h3>
    <p id="alkaline">
      Alkaline water is a much-hyped term these days. While it goes without
      saying that you shouldn't drink acidic water, many people have the idea
      that drinking alkaline water can help neutralize the acid in the body,
      which can then help slow the aging process and even prevent cancer.
      However, there is very little scientific evidence to showcase that
      alkaline water has these many health benefits. Plus, although there is no
      proof that alkaline water offers these miraculous health benefits, we also
      don't have any confirmation that it is harmful.
